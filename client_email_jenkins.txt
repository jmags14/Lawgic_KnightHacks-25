Subject: RE: Following up

hey team,
thanks for checking in. my neck is still killing me. i went to that MRI place you sent me to, i attached the bill from them. i think i also have one from the ER the day of the crash but i cant find it.

also that adjuster from state auto (the other guys insurance) called me AGAIN. i told him i had a lawyer but he was really pushy. his name is Bill Smith. can you make him stop?

my mom is taking me to another doc appt this friday at 3pm at Orlando Health.
